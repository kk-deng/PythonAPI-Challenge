# World Weather Analysis - An API Application
A python project was built to analyze the weather of 500+ cities over the world of varying distance from the equator.

## Background

This script generates data of 500+ cities with following info:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

And linear regression was applied for the above info in Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
